## Lobes and the sulcuses separating them

[__The central sulcus__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_sulcus) separates
the frontal lobe (starting with the precentral gyrus, where the primary motor
cortex resides -- movements) from the parietal lobe (starting with the
postcentral gyrus, where the primary somatosensory cortex resides -- touch).

[__The parieto-occipital sulcus__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parieto-occipital_sulcus)
separates the parietal lobe from the occipital lobe. 

The primary visual cortex is present in the occipital lobe and essentially the
whole visual system is present here.

[__The lateral sulcus__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_sulcus) separates the
temporal lobe from the parietal lobe. This is where the primary auditory cortex
is present -- it processes auditory signals which allows us to perceive sounds
and store them into our memory. In fact, the temporal lobe plays a role in
integrating visual information from the occipital lobe with other sensory
modalities and higher-order cognitive processes. Visual information processed in
the occipital lobe is transmitted to the temporal lobe, where it can be further
analyzed in the context of other sensory inputs and cognitive functions. The
temporal lobe (especially the hippocampus) is involved in cross-modal processing,
where it integrates visual, auditory, and other sensory information to create a
more comprehensive and meaningful representation of the environment.

## Areas

### [Broca's area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area)

Present in the frontal lobe of the _dominant hemisphere_ (usually the left one
-- the opposite of your dominant hand).

Traditionally, Broca's area has been associated with language production and
speech generation. Damage to this area, often referred to as Broca's aphasia,
can result in difficulty forming grammatically complex sentences, although
comprehension remains relatively intact. This led to the classic idea that
Broca's area plays a crucial role in the production of speech and grammatical
aspects of language.

Recent studies suggest that language processing involves a network of brain
regions, and Broca's area is just one part of this larger network. This region
is also involved in the planning and execution of the precise motor movements
required for speech production. It is also thought to be involved in cognitive
control functions and working memory essential for complex linguistic tasks.

Damage to Broca's area is commonly associated with telegraphic speech made up
of content vocabulary. For example, a person with Broca's aphasia may say
something like, "Drive, store. Mom." meaning to say, "My mom drove me to the
store today." Therefore, the content of the information is correct, but the
grammar and fluidity of the sentence is missing.

### [Wernicke's area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernicke%27s_area)

Present at the back of the temporal lobe (and in part in the parietal lobe) of 
the _dominant hemisphere_.

It is involved in the comprehension of written, signed and spoken language.

Damage caused to Wernicke's area results in receptive, fluent aphasia. This
means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but
the phrases will lack meaning.
