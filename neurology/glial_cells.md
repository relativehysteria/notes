# GLIAL CELLS

your nervous tissue is consisted of two kinds of cells: neurons and neuroglial
cells. neuroglial (short just _glial_) cells are essentially all cells within
the nervous tissue that aren't neurons.

## Astrocytes

greek for "star cell"

_ONLY FOUND IN THE CNS_ (brain and spinal cord).

### Blood-Brain Barrier

vessels within the brain are lined with endothelial cells (endothelial --
cellular lining _within_, epithelial -- any cellular lining, primarily _outside_).

between each endothelial cell are [tight junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction)
which control permeability across the vessel membrane.
on the outside of the vessels (capillaries in this case), there's also some
connective tissue (basal lamina -- 'base layer').

_then_ come the astrocytes. they generate growth factors which they send
through their foot processes (connected to the basal lamina) to the endothelial
cells, stimulating them to produce more tight junctions.

tight junctions selectively let molecules across the membrane. some molecules
are lipid soluble and diffuse directly through the membrane (e.g. o2, co2),
but many are not and these are 'selected' by the tight junctions (e.g. h2o or
ions). for example, proteins are not allowed to pass through at all because they
could undesirably stimulate/inhibit neurons.

#### [Circumventricular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumventricular_organs) Organs & Choroid Plexus

circumventricular -- just imagine you are circumventing the ventricular blood
brain barrier. 

some parts of the brain _break_ the blood-brain barrier; that is, the capillary
blood-barrier is _highly permeable_ as opposed to _hardly permeable_.

the first example is choroid plexus; the choroid plexus is not classified
as a CVO, because it doesn't contain nervous tissue.

then we have CVOs. there's a couple of them, but 3 of them are the most important:

1. [area postrema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_postrema) --
   little area within your medulla that samples your blood for toxins and other
   dumb shit. it is connected to your
   [chemoreceptor trigger zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptor_trigger_zone)
   which, if need be, initiates vomiting.
2. osmoreceptors -- [vascular organ of the lamina terminalis (VOLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_organ_of_lamina_terminalis)
   and the [subfornical organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfornical_organ)
   (below the fornix -- major output nerve fibers of the hippocampus) -- detect
   changes in concentration of solutes in the surrounding fluid. when there
   is an increase in osmolarity (higher concentration of solutes such as sodium),
   osmoreceptors are activated, triggering a response such as messaging the
   hypophysis (pituitary gland) to release the antidiuretic hormone to
   conserve water and stimulate thirst.
3. [hypothalamic-pituitary axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary_hormone)
