# GLIAL CELLS

your nervous tissue is consisted of two kinds of cells: neurons and neuroglial
cells. neuroglial (short just _glial_) cells are essentially all cells within
the nervous tissue that aren't neurons.

## Astrocytes

greek for "star cell"

_ONLY FOUND IN THE CNS_ (brain and spinal cord).

### Blood-Brain Barrier

vessels within the brain are lined with endothelial cells (endothelial --
cellular lining _within_, epithelial -- any cellular lining, primarily _outside_).

between each endothelial cell are [tight junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction)
which control permeability across the vessel membrane.
on the outside of the vessels (capillaries in this case), there's also some
connective tissue (basal lamina -- 'base layer').

_then_ come the astrocytes. they generate growth factors which they send
through their foot processes (connected to the basal lamina) to the endothelial
cells, stimulating them to produce more tight junctions.

tight junctions selectively let molecules across the membrane. some molecules
are lipid soluble and diffuse directly through the membrane (e.g. o2, co2),
but many are not and these are 'selected' by the tight junctions (e.g. h2o or
ions). for example, proteins are not allowed to pass through at all because they
could undesirably stimulate/inhibit neurons.

#### [Circumventricular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumventricular_organs) Organs & Choroid Plexus

circumventricular -- just imagine you are circumventing the ventricular blood
brain barrier. 

some parts of the brain _break_ the blood-brain barrier; that is, the capillary
blood-barrier is _highly permeable_ as opposed to _hardly permeable_.

the first example is choroid plexus; the choroid plexus is not classified
as a CVO, because it doesn't contain nervous tissue.

then we have CVOs. there's a couple of them, but 3 of them are the most important:

1. [area postrema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_postrema) --
   little area within your medulla that samples your blood for toxins and other
   dumb shit. it is connected to your
   [chemoreceptor trigger zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptor_trigger_zone)
   which, if need be, initiates vomiting.
2. osmoreceptors -- [vascular organ of the lamina terminalis (VOLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_organ_of_lamina_terminalis)
   and the [subfornical organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfornical_organ)
   (below the fornix -- major output nerve fibers of the hippocampus) -- detect
   changes in concentration of solutes in the surrounding fluid. when there
   is an increase in osmolarity (higher concentration of solutes such as sodium),
   osmoreceptors are activated, triggering a response such as messaging the
   hypophysis (pituitary gland) to release the antidiuretic hormone to
   conserve water and stimulate thirst.
3. [hypothalamic-pituitary axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary_hormone).
   essentially, hypothalamus secretes hormones, which causes the hypophysis to
   secrete different hormones, which signal different organic branches to secrete
   their "other things" (thyroxine, cortisol, testosterone/estradiol, igf-1 and milk).
   once enough of these "other things" (apart from milk) are produced,
   the hypothalamus notices it and stops stimulating hypophysis. 

### Potassium Buffer

during the repolarization phase of the action potential, potassium cations are
leaving the cell and accumulate in the extracellular space. there's also
plenty of potassium leaky channels on the soma, having the same effect.
some of the pumps reuptake the potassium (2 K in, 3 Na out), but overtime,
the amount of potassium outside the cell accumulates nonetheless.
to keep the concentration gradient at a decent equilibrium, the astrocytes
store some of that potassium inside of them. if the astrocytic concentration
gradient suffers (too much potassium on the inside), they have _gap junctions_
present on them, that connect them to other astrocytes, allowing them to push
some of their stored potassium into other astrocytes.

### Remove Excess Neurotransmitters

in the same sense that astrocytes work as a potassium buffer, in the case that
reuptake proteins get oversaturated, the astrocytes can buffer glutamate,
transform it into glutamine and transport it to the synaptic cleft, where
glutamine reuptake proteins work from there. glutamine can be turned back into
glutamate within the neuron. this works for glutaminergic neurons and gabergic
neurons as well (glutamine is a precursor to glutamate, which is a precursor to
gaba).

### Glycogen Reserve

astrocytes can store glucose, which they can turn into pyruvate, which they can
turn into lactate, which they can transport to nerve cells, where lactate can be
transformed back into pyruvate and eventually into ATP.

## Satellite Cells

pretty much like astrocytes, but in the PNS, not the CNS. they are surrounding
the cell bodies (therefore 'satellite') of your dorsal root ganglion and your
autonomic nervous system ganglia.

## Oligodendrocytes and Schwann Cells

#### Oligodendrocytes

* myelinate axons in the CNS (+ CN II)
* oligo -- one cell myelinates multiple axons (30 - 60)
* damage of the neuron doesn't regenerate
* demyelination -> multiple sclerosis

#### Schwann Cells

* myelinate axons in the PNS (spinal nerves + CNS III - XII)
* multiple cells myelinate one neuron
* damage of the neuron regenerates
* demyelination -> Guillan-Barr√© syndrome

### Structure of Schwann Cells and why they regenerate

schwann cells wrap around an axon, forming multiple layers, myelinating the axon.
the outtermost layer (just outside the myelin sheath) is called the
[_neurilemma_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurilemma), which can regenerate
damage to the neuron, as long as the body of the schwann cell (and the neurilemma)
isn't damaged.

### Myelin

conduction on a myelinated nerve = saltatory conduction.
conduction on an unmyelinated nerve = continous conduction.

ions can't enter/leave the axon in the areas where myelin is present, causing
them to move further down the body before further stimulating voltage gated
channels (and causing more influx/deflux) at
[nodes of ranvier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_of_Ranvier).

based on their amount of myelination, there are 3 groups of nerve fibers (axons):
(TODO: describe)
1. [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_A_nerve_fiber)
2. [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_B_nerve_fiber)
3. [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_C_nerve_fiber)

## Ependymal Cells

![endothelial wall kinds](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/2104_Three_Major_Capillary_Types.jpg/1920px-2104_Three_Major_Capillary_Types.jpg)

blood-csf barrier by the ventricles. essentially a substitute for the astrocytes.
endothelial cells at the bcsf barrier are fenestrated and therefore more
permeable. tight junctions are __not__ present between the endothelial cells,
but rather between the ependymal cells in the blood-csf barrier. however,
ependymal cells have different means of transport and their tight junctions are
not as significant as in the blood-brain barrier, because the blood-brain
barrier already filters and regulates the entry of substances into the brain
tissue. instead, ependyma focus on controlling the composition of the CSF by
actively transporting and regulating specific substances and also on circulating
it.

## Microglia

1. immune defense
2. surveillance and maintenance: they constantly survey the brain for
   abnormalities, damaged cells, and potential threats
3. phagocytosis: microglia are adept at engulfing and removing dead cells,
   debris, and damaged neurons, contributing to tissue repair and homeostasis
4. inflammation regulation: microglia play a role in regulating inflammation in
   the brain. they can produce both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
   substances, helping to balance the immune response.
5. synaptic pruning: during development, microglia are involved in refining
   neural circuits by eliminating excess or non-functional synapses,
   contributing to proper brain wiring. post-inflammation microglia also remove
   the branches from nerves near damaged tissue
6. modulation of neural activity: microglia can influence neuronal activity by
   releasing signaling molecules that affect synaptic function and
   neurotransmission.

in addition to phagocytosis, microglia in cultures release large amounts of
cytotoxic substances (hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide) which are also capable
of demyelinating axons.
