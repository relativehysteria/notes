# Parietal Lobe and the Cortexes

separated from the frontal lobe by the central sulcus, from the temporal lobe
by the lateral sulcus, from the occipital lobe by the parieto-occiptal sulcus.

the gyrus posterior to the central sulcus (postcentral gyrus) is the __primary
somatosensory cortex__, which is involved in conscious awareness of somatic
sensations (touch, pain, temperature, vibration...).

posterior to the primary somatosensory cortex is the __somatosensory association
cortex__, which is involved with analyzing of sensations, their recognition
and their storage to memory. in other words, it provides _meaning_ to and
_recognition_ of the sensations that we feel.

posterior to the somatosensory association cortex is the __posterior association
area__ (because it overlaps with the occipital and temporal lobes, it is
sometimes called __the parietal-occipital-temporal cortex__).
involved with spatial coordination, since it occupies 3 lobes at once, it
processes these sensations:
1. somatic (parietal)
2. visual (occipital)
3. auditory (temporal)
