The ventricular system is a set of four interconnected cavities, lined with
a membrane called the __choroid plexus__, which is composed of neuroglial
(non-neuron) cells called ependymal cells. These cells are designed to secrete
CSF. Thus, the main role of the ventricles is to produce and distribute CSF.

There are, in a sense, four ventricles: I and II are the lateral ventricles,
both present in each of the hemispheres, and between the hemispheres, there are
III and IV.


The choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles is present on their bottom.

Connecting the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle is a set of
tubes/channels called the interventricular foramina (singular: foramen -- otvor).
The ventricles are separated by the septum pellucidum ('translucent wall').

Connecting the third and the fourth ventricle is the cerebral aqueduct.

### CSF Circulation

The CSF is drained from the fourth ventricle in the following ways:
1. Proceeding from the central aqueduct into the central canal of the spinal
   cord (the central canal is the primary CSF filled ventricle of the spinal cord)
2. Through the median aperture (bottom of the fourth ventricle) into subarachnoid
   space via the cisterna magna
3. Through the lateral apertures (sides of the fourth ventricle) into subarachnoid
   space via the cistern of the great cerebral vein
