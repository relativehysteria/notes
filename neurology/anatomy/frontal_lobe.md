# Frontal Lobe and the Cortexes

separated from the parietal lobe by the central sulcus and from the temporal
lobe by the lateral sulcus/fissure (sylvian fissure).

the gyrus anterior to the central sulcus is the __primary motor cortex__, which
is involved in voluntary movement (particularly of _skeletal muscles_).

next gyrus, anterior to the primary motor cortex, is the motor association
cortex, made up of the __premotor cortex__ and the __supplementary motor area__
(SMA -- located more on the midline of the gyrus -- largely separated by the
longitudinal fissure). these are involved in planning, sequence and execution of
movement.

next, anterior to the motor association cortex, are the __frontal eye fields__,
which are involved in the voluntary rapid eye/saccadic movements
(so called [saccades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade)).

anterior to your eye fields is the __prefrontal cortex__. involved with memory,
motor planning and _personality and behavior_.

the last area in the frontal lobe, on the bottom, close to the temporal lobe,
always in the dominant hemisphere (95% right if right-handed, 70% right if
left-handed), is the __broca's area__. it is involved with muscles of speech.

## Primary Motor Cortex (Brodmann's Area 4)

![nerve pathways of the primary motor cortex](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Gray764.png)

involved in voluntary motor movements,
the primary cortex formulates (together with many other areas) and executes the
_final motor plan_ (the final motor plan is influenced by factors such as sensory
input, environmental cues, and the individual's previous motor experiences.
the brain integrates these inputs to generate a motor plan that optimally
coordinates the necessary muscle contractions and joint movements to carry out a
specific action). the plan is 'executed' by being sent down a certain tract:

1. __corticospinal tract__: ending by the anterior grey horns of the spinal cord,
stimulating the alpha neurons within them, controlling the limbs and the trunk.
this tract is further divided into __anterior__ and __lateral__ corticospinal
tracts (both can be seen on the picture above).  
1.1. the _lateral_ forms about 90% of connections in the tract; they run around
the lateral grey horn and become mostly contralateral at the level of the medulla.
these control limbs and digits.  
1.2. the _anterior_ forms about 10% connections in the tract; they run around the
anterior grey horn and remain ipsilateral throughout the spinal cord, just before
decussating at the level of the spinal nerve in which they exit. these control
muscles of the trunk, shoulders and the neck.
2. __corticobulbar tract__: ending in the medullary pyramids of the medulla
oblongata (this can also be seen above -- the geniculate fibers). these
stimulate nuclei of the cranial nerves that supply the skeletal muscles of the
head and (partially) the neck

### Somatotopy of the Primary Motor Cortex

_also, look at the nerve pathways above: you can see that neurons of the 
corticobulbar tract are more distal from the longitudinal fissure, whereas
neurons of the corticospinal tract are more proximal._

some body parts require finer control as opposed to others (for example,
hands and fingers and thumbs as opposed to eyebrows and eyelids) and as such
take up "more space" within the cortex -- there's a higher amount of motor units
for the specific parts.

knowledge of the somatotopy of the primary motor cortex is also important because
of strokes; there are two arteries supplying this cortex:
the __anterior cerebral__ and the __middle cerebral__.

the ACB is supplying the more medial aspect of the motor cortex (that is, the
trunk and the lower limbs). stroke of this artery leads to lower extremity
paralysis. the MCB is supplying the more lateral aspect of the cortex,
leading to paralysis of the upper extremities, head and neck.
