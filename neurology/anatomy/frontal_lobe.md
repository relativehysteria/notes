# Frontal Lobe

separated from the parietal lobe by the central sulcus and from the temporal
lobe by the lateral sulcus/fissure (sylvian fissure).

the gyrus anterior to the central sulcus is the __primary motor cortex__, which
is involved in voluntary movement (particularly of _skeletal muscles_).

next gyrus, anterior to the primary motor cortex, is the motor association
cortex, made up of the __premotor cortex__ and the __supplementary motor area__
(SMA -- located more on the midline of the gyrus -- largely separated by the
longitudinal fissure). these are involved in planning, sequence and execution of
movement.

next, anterior to the motor association cortex, are the __frontal eye fields__,
which are involved in the voluntary rapid eye/saccadic movements
(so called [saccades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade)).

anterior to your eye fields is the __prefrontal cortex__. involved with memory,
motor planning and _personality and behavior_.

the last area in the frontal lobe, on the bottom, close to the temporal lobe,
always in the dominant hemisphere (95% right if right-handed, 70% right if
left-handed), is the __broca's area__. it is involved with muscles of speech.
