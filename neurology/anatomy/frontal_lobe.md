# Frontal Lobe and the Cortexes

separated from the parietal lobe by the central sulcus and from the temporal
lobe by the lateral sulcus/fissure (sylvian fissure).

the gyrus anterior to the central sulcus is the __primary motor cortex__, which
is involved in voluntary movement (particularly of _skeletal muscles_).

next gyrus, anterior to the primary motor cortex, is the motor association
cortex, made up of the __premotor cortex__ and the __supplementary motor area__
(SMA -- located more on the midline of the gyrus -- largely separated by the
longitudinal fissure). these are involved in planning, sequence and execution of
movement.

next, anterior to the motor association cortex, are the __frontal eye fields__,
which are involved in the voluntary rapid eye/saccadic movements
(so called [saccades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade)).

anterior to your eye fields is the __prefrontal cortex__. involved with memory,
motor planning and _personality and behavior_.

the last area in the frontal lobe, on the bottom, close to the temporal lobe,
always in the dominant hemisphere (95% right if right-handed, 70% right if
left-handed), is the __broca's area__. it is involved with muscles of speech.

## Primary Motor Cortex (Brodmann's Area 4)

![nerve pathways of the primary motor cortex](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Gray764.png)

involved in voluntary motor movements,
the primary cortex formulates (together with many other areas) and executes the
_final motor plan_ (the final motor plan is influenced by factors such as sensory
input, environmental cues, and the individual's previous motor experiences.
the brain integrates these inputs to generate a motor plan that optimally
coordinates the necessary muscle contractions and joint movements to carry out a
specific action). the plan is 'executed' by being sent down a certain tract:

1. __corticospinal tract__: ending by the anterior grey horns of the spinal cord,
stimulating the alpha neurons within them, controlling the limbs and the trunk.
this tract is further divided into __anterior__ and __lateral__ corticospinal
tracts (both can be seen on the picture above).  
1.1. the _lateral_ forms about 90% of connections in the tract; they run around
the lateral grey horn and become mostly contralateral at the level of the medulla.
these control limbs and digits.  
1.2. the _anterior_ forms about 10% connections in the tract; they run around the
anterior grey horn and remain ipsilateral throughout the spinal cord, just before
decussating at the level of the spinal nerve in which they exit. these control
muscles of the trunk, shoulders and the neck.
2. __corticobulbar tract__: ending in the medullary pyramids of the medulla
oblongata (this can also be seen above -- the geniculate fibers). these
stimulate nuclei of the cranial nerves that supply the skeletal muscles of the
head and (partially) the neck

### Somatotopy of the Primary Motor Cortex

![somatotopy of the primary motor cortex](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Figure_35_03_04.jpg)

_also, look at the nerve pathways above: you can see that neurons of the 
corticobulbar tract are more distal from the longitudinal fissure, whereas
neurons of the corticospinal tract are more proximal._

some body parts require finer control as opposed to others (for example,
hands and fingers and thumbs as opposed to eyebrows and eyelids) and as such
take up "more space" within the cortex -- there's a higher amount of motor units
for the specific parts.

knowledge of the somatotopy of the primary motor cortex is also important because
of strokes; there are two arteries supplying this cortex:
the __anterior cerebral__ and the __middle cerebral__.

![arteries of the brain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Sobo_1909_3_548.png/1024px-Sobo_1909_3_548.png)

the ACB is supplying the more medial aspect of the motor cortex (that is, the
trunk and the lower limbs). stroke of this artery leads to lower extremity
paralysis. the MCB is supplying the more lateral aspect of the cortex,
leading to paralysis of the upper extremities, head and neck.

## Motor Association Cortex -- Premotor + SMA (Brodmann's Area 6)

also contribute to voluntary motor movement, but is more involved in
_fine motor movement_. just like the primary motor cortex, they supply lower
motor neurons, but particularly _of the trunk (axial muscles) and of the
proximal limbs (hips and shoulders)_.

this cortex is also involved in __planning, sequence and execution__ of motor
movement.

essentially, the motor association cortex is a part of two communication feedback
loops: one with the _basal ganglia_ (where they come up with modified motor
activity -- initiate wanted movements, prevent unwanted movements, modulate
movements in a particular way) and one with the _cerebellum_.

the cerebellum receives various input, goes through all of it, combining it and
sends its modifications back to the motor cortical areas. the input is like so:
1. from your inner ear -- mostly static and dynamic equilibrium
2. sensations: your touch, positional awareness of your muscles, tendons, joints
   in a three-dimensional space
3. the motor plan that the premotor and supplementary cortex want to initiate

more on that, read [this shit](https://neupsykey.com/cognitive-functions-of-the-premotor-systems/).
```
These two structures provide feedback essential for the smooth execution of
skilled movements and thus are important for motor learning, the improvement in
motor skills through practice. The cerebellum and the basal ganglia store
memory for unconscious motor skills through pathways that are separate from
those used to store factual memories of events that can be recalled consciously.
```

### The Whole of the Motor Cortex

_in a sense, you can understand that the primary motor cortex is the final
executor of the motor plan, whereas the motor association cortex is the 
primary creator and modifier of the plan. the plan is initiated and created
somewhere, modified by the association cortex, sent to the primary motor cortex
which then executes it. the association cortex is also involved in storing
information about how fine motor movements are executed, such that it can be
later retrieved to modify the motor plan._

## Prefrontal Cortex (Brodmann's Areas 8-14, 24, 25, 32, 45-47)

involved in your:
1. personality and behaviors
2. your working memory (short-term + rehearsal)
3. cognition (ability to learn and think)
4. decision making (reasoning and judgment)
5. motor planning ([10.1098/rstb.2020.0524](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8710885/))

the prefrontal cortex has _a fuck ton_ of connections to other areas in the brain,
e.g. the hippocampus (memory and information consolidation), the limbic system
(your personality; the hypothalamus, the amygdala, etc.),
[the ventral tegmental area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral_tegmental_area)
(origin of the dopaminergic cell bodies, so your reward/addiction system),
[posterior association area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_cortex)
(visual, auditory and somatic sensations are sent to the PAA, where they are
integrated together and sent to the prefrontal cortex, which can be involved with
motor planning, because it can communicate with your basal ganglia).

### Fronto-Temporal Dementia

symptoms of frontal lobe damage:
1. aggression, hostility, irritability..
2. memory loss (retrograde _and_ anterograde, i.e. learning)
3. inappropriate reasoning and judgment (hypersexual behavior, gambling, apathy..)
4. parkinson's like motor deficits

more damage to the temporal lobe can cause inability to comprehend language,
so on top of everything else, aphasia.

## Frontal Eye Fields

involved in voluntary rapid eye movements (saccadic eye movement).

there are three important nuclei within your brainstem; nuclei of the cranial
nerves [III (oculomotor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculomotor_nerve) and
[VI (abducens)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abducens_nerve) and the 
[paramedian pontine reticular formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedian_pontine_reticular_formation).

frontal eye fields move the eyes like so (example given on the right FEF):
1. the right FEF signals the left paramedian reticular formation.
2. the left paramedian reticular formation signals to the left CN VI
3. the left CN VI abducts the left eye via the lateral rectus muscle,
   causing it to move to the left. at the same time, this nucleus signals to
   the right CN III.
4. the right CN III abducts the right eye via the medial rectus muscle,
   causing it to move to the left.
5. in the end, both eyes move to the left

### Lesion to the FEF

lesion to a FEF causes the eye to be unable to move to the contralateral side,
resulting in ipsilateral conjugate gaze deviation. that is, damage to right FEF
causes the eye to gaze towards the right side.
