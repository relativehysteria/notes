## Freud (psychoanalysis)

_superseded by behaviorism_

we don't really learn about him. he died in 1939 and his idea of psychoanalysis
is _not falsifiable_; i.e. hard to prove, hard to disprove. but he did come up
with the idea of id, ego and super-ego (id: the chase after everything "good",
super-ego: the guardian angel of yours that tells you to not be bad and
perverted, ego: you, the in-between) and essentially the whole theory of
repression, coping mechanisms and subconscious thought and affect.

that being said, he was against pharmacotherapy and believed it to be overused,
helping with the symptoms but hiding away the root cause.

### unconsciousness

__most of what our brains do is unconscious__.

one theory behind this is that some things are better made to be unconscious,
because if a person doesn't know they have them, they will not give them away.
that is; if you believe your own lie (that you only _consciously don't know_ is
a lie -- you believe it), you become a better liar.

## Skinner and Watson (behaviorism)

_superseded by cognitive psychology_

behaviorism has existed before skinner; it was pioneered by john watson.

skinner packaged, publicized, developed them scientifically and presented them
to the scientific and popular community.

the view of behaviorism is that everything you know/are, is the result of your
experience. essentially sartre; existence precedes essence.

1. decline in the tendency to respond to stimuli that are familiar due to
   repeated exposure (ticking of a clock, noise of traffic)
2. classical conditioning; association between stimuli (pavlov's dog :)  
2.1. unconditioned stimulus -- shit you don't have to learn. food will make you salivate, bell alone will not.  
2.2. conditioned stimulus -- shit you have to learn. if the bell is rung as you get the food, eventually you will salivate when the bell is rung.
3. awkward/instrumental conditioning; success of actions -- learning what does and what doesn't work (rewarding mechanism; negative and positive reinforcement)

### phobias

built on conditioning; maybe if you were bitten by a dog as a child
(the dog is unconditioned, the bite is unconditioned, but the presence of both
is conditioned), you will be conditioned to associate dogs with bites and
therefore be afraid of them. likewise, if you simply spend time with dogs that
don't bite, the condition bond will be extinguished and the phobia will be cured.

__that being said__, the sort of phobias you're likely to have have a lot to do
with your evolutionary history, rather than your experiences (that is, they're
not always conditioned -- monkeys, apes and humans, for example, tend to be
afraid of snakes all alike, with no prior experience)

### partial reinforcement effect

if you don't reinforce a behavior all the time,
it lasts for a longer time. for example, slot machines; if you condition someone
that they will always give you money, once they stop getting the money, they stop
playing. however, if you condition them that they only get money every once in a
while, but they do eventually, they keep playing even if they don't get the money
for a long time.

### garcia effect (conditioned taste aversion)

acquired aversion to the taste
of food that was paired with aversive stimuli. for example, if you get totally
fucking smashed with alcohol, later on eat a kebab and then puke in the evening
as a result of you getting fucking smashed, you will dislike eating kebab as well
(true story; fuck kebab).

### chomsky destroying behaviorism

when it comes to humans, the notions of reward and punishment that skinner
tried to extend on humans are so vague that it's not science anymore.
chomsky more or less proved that behaviorism is also unfalsifiable, just like
freud's psychoanalysis. conditioning is real, but it doesn't explain everything
and as such, behaviorism is far from perfect. it provides powerful techniques
for training, particularly non-verbal creatures (animals, young children,
severely autistic/retarded).
