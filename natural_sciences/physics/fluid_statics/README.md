density is mass per unit volume; $rho = \frac{m}{V}$ -- the amount of massive
particles in a volume; unit is $\frac{kg}{m^3}$
    
pressure is force applied over area: $P = \frac{F}{A}$; unit is $Pascal$
* gases -- pressure results from gas molecules colliding with the walls of their
  container, creating a force per unit area.
* liquids and solids -- pressure is due to the forces between closely packed
  molecules. In liquids, molecules slide past each other while in solids, they
  vibrate in fixed positions. The interactions and repulsions between these
  molecules contribute to the overall pressure.

knowing $P = \frac{mg}{A}$ and $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$, one can derive pressure due
to weight of a fluid as $P = h \rho g$. This equation is valid even without
a container; it represents the pressure due to the weight of any fluid of
average density $\rho$ at any depth $h$ below its surface.

_pascal's principle_: a change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is
transmitted _undiminished_ to all portions of the fluid and to the walls
of its container, such that force applied to an area of the container in one
place must be equal to the force applied to an area in another place. that is;
$\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}$. that is to say, pressure is always uniform
within the container: $P_1 = P_2$

imagine the following: a hydraulic system of two connected cylinders, 
one smaller $A_1$ and one 5 times larger $A_2$. If a force of $100N$ is applied
to $A_1$, the force applied outwards to the other cylinder must be 5 times
larger as well. the pressures are the same, however: $P_1 = P_2$, because the
larger force is applied over a larger area. 

in other words; just like in momentum the time over which a force acts is of
utmost importance, in hydrostatics the area plays this role. conservation of
energy tells us that the system cannot do more work than is done on it.

_archimedes' principle_: the buoyant force on an object equals the weight of
the fluid it displaces; $F_b = \rho V g$. the fraction of an object that
is submerged in a liquid is given by this equation:
$f_{submerged} = \frac{\rho_{object}}{\rho_{liquid}}$
