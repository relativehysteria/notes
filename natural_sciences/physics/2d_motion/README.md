multidimensional kinematics is just vectors

ex. velocity vector of magnitude 50 under a 30 degree angle has the following
components:
1. $v_x = 50 * cos(30^{\circ})$
2. $v_y = 50 * sin(30^{\circ})$

horizontal and vertical velocities/accelerations only ever apply to their vector
component; gravity ONLY ever changes the vertical velocity, therefore 
two objects with the same vertical velocity fall on the ground at the same time,
even if one had a greater total velocity (because of greater horizontal velocity).

the range of a projectile on level ground for which air resistance is negligible
is given by $\Delta x = \frac{v_0^2 sin(2 \theta_0)}{g}$
