if a force acts on an obect off the center of its mass, the object will rotate
around the center of its mass.

formula for the center of mass is $X = \frac{\displaystyle \sum m_i x_i}{\displaystyle \sum_ m_i}$.
so, for example, if we are given three objects of three different masses,
the equation looks like so: $X = \frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2 + m_3 x_3}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3}$
