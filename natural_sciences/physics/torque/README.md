torque = otáčivý moment

if a force acts on an object off the center of its mass, the object will rotate
around the center of its mass.

formula for the center of mass is $X = \frac{\displaystyle \sum m_i x_i}{\displaystyle \sum m_i}$.

formula for torque is $\tau = F * d$, unit is _Newton-meter_.

altough the equation is the same as work,
it _isn't_ work -- work is force applied over distance in the same direction $d$
(translation), whereas torque is force applied over circular path (rotation),
distance $d$ from the center, in a perpendicular fashion.
torque is the rotational analogue of linear force.

clockwise torque is negative, anti-clockwise torque is positive
