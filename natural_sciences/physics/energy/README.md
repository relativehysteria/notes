work = energy transferred by force; $Work = Force \times distance \times \cos \theta$. unit is newton-meter, or joule.
energy = ability to do work
power = the rate at which work is done; $P = \frac{W}{t} = F \times v \times \cos \theta$. unit is watt (joule per second).

kinetic energy is $K = \frac{mv^2}{2}$. unit is also joule.

'potential energy' is the work that can be potentially done.
i.e. if you hold something above the ground and you let go of it, gravity will pull
it towards the ground. the object has a potential energy equal to the work gravity would do.
if you hold something on a depressed spring and let go of it and the spring pushes it,
the potential energy of the object while it is standing on the depressed spring
is equal to the work that will be done when the spring pushes the object.
