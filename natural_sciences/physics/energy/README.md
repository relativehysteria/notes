work/práce = energy transferred by force; $Work = Force \cdot distance \cdot \cos \theta$. unit is newton-meter, or joule.  
energy = ability to do work  
power/výkon = the rate at which work is done; $P = \frac{W}{t} = F \cdot v \cdot \cos \theta$. unit is watt (joule per second).  
input power/příkon = dodaná energie stroji za dobu t  
efficiency/účinnost = poměr příkonu a výkonu (kolik energie se ztratí); $\eta = \frac{výkon}{příkon}$ výsledek je v procentech

kinetic energy is $K = \frac{mv^2}{2}$. unit is also joule

the work-energy theorem equates
$W_{net} = KE_f - KE_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$ -- this is true
even for work done by forces of different magnitude and direction.

'potential energy' is the work that can be potentially done.
i.e. if you hold something above the ground and you let go of it, gravity will pull
it towards the ground. the object has a potential energy equal to the work gravity would do.
if you hold something on a depressed spring and let go of it and the spring pushes it,
the potential energy of the object while it is standing on the depressed spring
is equal to the work that will be done when the spring pushes the object.

the gravitational potential energy in a uniform gravitational field is
$\Delta PEg = m g \Delta h$.

although no real gravitational field is ever uniform
($F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$ -- $F_g$ gets smaller with rising $r$), 
small enough distances from massive enough objects don't have a very noticable
effect, so the equation can be usually used for calculating the gravitational 
potential energy on earth. the more accurate equation following the
gravitational distance relationship would be the integration of gravitational
force with respect to $r$:
$PE_g = -\int_{\infty}^{r} (G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}) dr = \underline{-(G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r})}$

potential energy is based on hooke's law $F = k \Delta x$
($k$ is a spring constant and $x$ is the length of deformation).
the force increases linearly from 0 at the start to $kx$ in the fully stretched
position. the average force is $\frac{kx_i + kx_f}{2}$, which for $kx_i = 0$
is $\frac{kx_f}{2}$. given $W = Fx$, potential energy of a string is therefore
$PE = Fx = \frac{kx}{2} x = \frac{kx^2}{2}$.
