je to (afaik) z roku 2007, takze znacne zastarale, ale facha to. :)

## pohledy na vec

### the astonishing hypothesis

* __francis crick__
* "a person's mental activities are entirely due to the behavior of nerve cells, glial cells, and the atoms, ions, and molecules that make them up and influence them."
* scientific consensus that dualism is wrong
* the mind is what the brain does

### dualism

* old shit
* __descartes__
* animals -- robots. people -- "immaterial souls"
* humans -- spontaneous, coordinated..
* having a body: always uncertain. having a mind: always certain. the soul that i am is highly distinct from the body
* "most people" believe they can survive the destruction of their bodies (heaven etc.)

## neuron

![anatomy of a neuron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Blausen_0657_MultipolarNeuron.png/1920px-Blausen_0657_MultipolarNeuron.png)

[details here](../../neurology/neuron.md)

* dendrite -- get signals from other neurons (excitatory, inhibitory)
* axon -- signals are sent along the axon (can be LONG -- spinal cord -> legs)
* myelin sheath -- helps the neuron fire quicker (during depolarization)

__signals are all or nothing__, therefore, intensity is encoded like so:
* frequency of firing
* number of neurons firing

#### types of neurons
* sensory -- take information from the world
* motor -- telling the muscles what to do
* inter-neurons -- connect sensory and motor neurons

## brain

neurons communicate either electrically (at the synapse terminal), or __chemically__ (electrical signal travels through the axon and at the synapse terminal releases neurotransmitters).
most pharmacology fiddles with neurotransmitters.

brains are resistant to damage. its tissue is slow, but the brain is extremely parallelized.

some things are duplicated in the hemispheres, some are more prevalent in one of them.
if you're right-handed: language in left, math and music on the right.

your left hemisphere controls the right side of your body,
your right hemisphere controls the left side.

#### kinds of drugs

* __agonists__ -- increases effects of neurotransmitters (increases production/releases, decreases cleanup/retake, mimicks them)
* __antagonists__ -- decreases effects of neurotransmitters (decreases production/releases, increases cleanup, destroys them, cover a dendrite such that the neurotransmitters don't reach it)

* _alcohol_ -- inhibitory: it inhibits the inhibitory parts of your brain (that tell you to not be dum dum). if you take enough, it inhibits the excitatory parts, too, and you pass out.
* _amphetamines_ -- excitatory: increase the amounts of arousal (increase amounts of norepinephrine)

#### automatic action

some things you don't need your brain for:

* newborn sucking
* withdrawal from pain
* erection
* vomiting

#### key parts

* medulla oblongata (prodlouzena micha) -- heart rate, respiration
* cerebellum (mozecek) -- body balance, muscular coordination
* hypothalamus -- feeding, hunger, thirst, sleep
* cortex -- the outer layer (80% of our brain). all the neat stuff happens here. various different lobes

brain is topographical -- two parts close on the body are close on the brain's projection area (i.e. tongue and jaw are close, fingers and hands..).
the size of each part of projection area depends on the complexity of the part of the body it controls (i.e. hands and fingers are controlled by a larger portion than, for example, the neck).

<1/4 of the cortex contains projection areas (that control your body), the rest is involved in language, reasoning, moral thought, etc.

### neurological disorders

* [apraxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apraxia) -- difficulty with motor planning (not paralysis -- they can move, but can't coordinate movements)
* [agnosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosia) -- inability to process sensory information (they can feel, see, taste, hear, but are unable to recognize the objects, persons, shapes, sounds...)
* [aphasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia) -- unable to comprehend/formulate language (they can hear but not understand, they can speak, but gibberish, or only few words)
