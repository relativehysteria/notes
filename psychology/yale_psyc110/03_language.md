idk i'm bored of language

### instinctivness and importance of language

all languages are complex enough to describe abstract things.

darwin writes, "man has an instinctive tendency to speak" -- language comes
naturally.

every human society has language. cultures with differing languages (i.e.
cultures that don't understand each other), for example, slaves of different
cultures on the slave market, tend to develop _pidgin_.

> A pidgin is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups of people that do not have a language in common: typically, its vocabulary and grammar are limited and often drawn from several languages. It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups).

children of pidgin-speaking people tend to learn the pidgin as their native
language, expanding and elaborating it into a full-fledged language -- a creole.

there are examples of children being able to fully learn sign language despite
the adults around not being fluent. children don't use the language system
the adults use -- they creoleize it.

language is a natural human trait and everyone neurologically healthy can learn
it as long as there is any language at all around.

### segmentation

spoken language doesn't have pauses between words -- minds merely interpret
them as present, but they are not there. children have to learn languages in
context (know where words end by, for example, knowing the words) to understand
them. insufficient knowledge of context leads to misrepresentation
(of, for example, lyrics). 

__top down processing__ -- if you know what something is beforehand,
you hear it that way and fill in the gaps.

other linguistic stuff.. vocabularies, sounds, maps, infinite combinations..
