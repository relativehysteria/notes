sometimes, intuition is exactly wrong about the future. __hindsight bias__:
if we predict that something bad will happen, and it does happen, we act in
hindsight "i told you so". if it does not happen -- we forget.

people naturally tend to be overconfident and perceive order and symbolism
in random events.

## brain

requires ~20% of body's energy

it's like a russian nesting doll -- the outter most layer is the newest.

#### the old brain

* brain stem (mozkovy kmen) -- spinal cord enters the skull
* medulla (prodlouzena micha) -- automatically controls; heartbeat, breathing
* pons (varoluv most) -- coordination in automatic functions; arousal, sleep, relaying information between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex
* thalamus -- intake of sensory information related to seeing, hearing, touching, tasting
* reticular formation (retikularni formace) -- general awareness of motion, sensation and arousal (noise, light, vibration) that gets relayed to the cortex (through the thalamus )
* cerebellum (mozecek) -- non-verbal learning and memory, perception of time and emotion modulation

#### the limbic system

* amygdala -- bean sized clusters of neurons involved in memory consolidation and _emotion_
* hypothalamus -- regulates body temperature, circadian rhythms, hunger, helps govern the endocrine system (especially the pituitary gland), pleasure and reward
* pituitary gland (hypofyza) -- secretes many different hormones, some of which affect other glands
* hippocampus -- central to learning and memory (damage = anterograde amnesia)

#### the gray matter -- cerebrum

about 85% of the brain weight. oversees your ability to think, speak and perceive

the hemispheres are connected with the corpus callosum. language production is
controlled largely by the left hemisphere, certain creative functions by the right.

the cerebral cortex is divided into these lobes
* frontal -- speaking, planning, judging, abstract thinking, personality
* parietal -- sense of touch, body position
* occipital -- sight
* temporal -- comprehension of sound and speech


## sensation and perception

absolute threshold of sensation -- the minimum stimulation needed to register
a particular stimulus fifty percent of the time.

difference threshold -- when you can actually tell a difference.
_weber's law_ -- we perceive differences on a logarithmic scale (e.g. sound).

_perception_ = how we order and process information and sensations.  
_perceptual set_ = psychological factors that determine how you perceive your environment (seeing is believing, BUT ALSO believing is seeing). culture is important to it.

### form perception

_figure - ground relationship_ = the organization of the visual field into objects
(the figures) that stand out from their surroundings (the ground).

#### rules of grouping

* proximity -- we group nearby figures together 
* continuity -- perceiving smooth patterns, ignoring broken ones
* closure -- we fill in gaps to create a complete, whole object

### depth perception

the ability to see objects in three dimensions

_binocular cues_ -- depend on the use of both use, for example, retinal disparity
(latency between signals, the angle -- object close to your eyes is seen from two different points)

_monocular cues_ -- relative size and height, linear perspective, texture gradient, interposition, motion

## consciousness

_here defined as_ our awareness of ourselves and our environment

### cognitive neuroscience 

the study of how brain activity is linked with our mental processes.

* structural imagining -- brain's anatomy; good for identifying tumors and diseases
* functional imagining -- electromagnetic or metabolic activity; good for identifying correlations between stimuli actions and brain activity

selective attention -- focus of conscious awareness on a particular stimulus or group of stimuli
(there's *a lot* of stimuli at once and we are consciously aware of only a few
of them at once -- the most important ones usually)  
selective inattention also exists

## sleep

you're still alive and conscious

* NREM-1 -- hypnagogic sensations (body jerking)
* NREM-2 -- sleep spindles, but can be easily awakened
* NREM-3 -- brief dreams
* REM -- vivid visual dreams

during REM, your motor cortex is *veeery active* but your brain stem blocks the
messages, leaving your muscles so relaxed that you're basically paralysed.
this repeats every ~90 minutes

bad sleep (not enough or too much) causes hormones to become whacky (dysfunctions,
overeating, depression..).

you're able to dream of *all stimuli* stumbled upon during the day -- including
the unconscious ones.

## altered states

_hypnosis_ -- calm, trance-like state during which you tend to have heightened concentration
and focus, and in which you're typically more open to suggestion

_psychoactive drugs_ -- chemical substances that alter your mood and perception

* depressants -- mellow, slowness, suppression of bodily activity; alcohol, tranquilizers, opiates
* stimulants -- excite neural activity, self-confidence, speed up bodily activity; caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines
* hallucinogens -- distort perceptions, evoke sensory images; plant, fungal, synthetic (e.g. lsd)

## memory

* recall -- retrieval of information learned earlier
  ("---- is the capital of greece")
* recognition -- identification of items learned earlier
  ("which of the following was not an ancient city in greece")
* relearning -- reinforcing old information (relearn shit you have forgotten)

__atkinson-shiffrin memory model__
1. sensory register -- sensory information enters memory
2. short-term memory -- receives and holds input from both the sensory register
   and the long-term memory
3. long-term memory -- essentially a hard drive that stores *everything* such
   that memories can be later retrieved

__working memory__ -- conscious, active processing of incoming auditory and 
visual-spatial information, and of information retrieved from long-term memory.
[baddeley-hitch working memory model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory)
essentially replaces the short-term memory in the atkinson-shiffrin model.

_explicit memory_ -- shit that you specifically want to remember  
_implicit memory_ -- shit that you remember without explicitly caring about it
(this is how you learn most of your shit -- associations and stimuli; this is
what behaviorism is about)

long-term memory storage is not quite understood.. yet.

_shallow processing_ -- encoding information on basic auditory or visual levels,
based on the sound, structure or appearance of a word (e.g. brain anatomy and
latin words, without understanding the latin behind them)  
_deep processing_ -- encoding semantically, based on actual meaning associated
with the words (actually understanding the latin and therefore easily knowing
what is what)
