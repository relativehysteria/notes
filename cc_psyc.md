sometimes, intuition is exactly wrong about the future. __hindsight bias__:
if we predict that something bad will happen, and it does happen, we act in
hindsight "i told you so". if it does not happen -- we forget.

people naturally tend to be overconfident and perceive order and symbolism
in random events.

## brain

requires ~20% of body's energy

it's like a russian nesting doll -- the outter most layer is the newest.

#### the old brain

* brain stem (mozkovy kmen) -- spinal cord enters the skull
* medulla (prodlouzena micha) -- automatically controls; heartbeat, breathing
* pons (varoluv most) -- coordination in automatic functions; arousal, sleep, relaying information between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex
* thalamus -- intake of sensory information related to seeing, hearing, touching, tasting
* reticular formation (retikularni formace) -- general awareness of motion, sensation and arousal (noise, light, vibration) that gets relayed to the cortex (through the thalamus )
* cerebellum (mozecek) -- non-verbal learning and memory, perception of time and emotion modulation

#### the limbic system

* amygdala -- bean sized clusters of neurons involved in memory consolidation and _emotion_
* hypothalamus -- regulates body temperature, circadian rhythms, hunger, helps govern the endocrine system (especially the pituitary gland), pleasure and reward
* pituitary gland (hypofyza) -- secretes many different hormones, some of which affect other glands
* hippocampus -- central to learning and memory (damage = anterograde amnesia)

#### the gray matter -- cerebrum

about 85% of the brain weight. oversees your ability to think, speak and perceive

the hemispheres are connected with the corpus callosum. language production is
controlled largely by the left hemisphere, certain creative functions by the right.

the cerebral cortex is divided into these lobes
* frontal -- speaking, planning, judging, abstract thinking, personality
* parietal -- sense of touch, body position
* occipital -- sight
* temporal -- comprehension of sound and speech


## sensation and perception

absolute threshold of sensation -- the minimum stimulation needed to register
a particular stimulus fifty percent of the time.

difference threshold -- when you can actually tell a difference.
_weber's law_ -- we perceive differences on a logarithmic scale (e.g. sound).

_perception_ = how we order and process information and sensations.  
_perceptual set_ = psychological factors that determine how you perceive your environment (seeing is believing, BUT ALSO believing is seeing). culture is important to it.

### form perception

_figure - ground relationship_ = the organization of the visual field into objects
(the figures) that stand out from their surroundings (the ground).

#### rules of grouping

* proximity -- we group nearby figures together 
* continuity -- perceiving smooth patterns, ignoring broken ones
* closure -- we fill in gaps to create a complete, whole object

### depth perception

the ability to see objects in three dimensions

_binocular cues_ -- depend on the use of both use, for example, retinal disparity
(latency between signals, the angle -- object close to your eyes is seen from two different points)

_monocular cues_ -- relative size and height, linear perspective, texture gradient, interposition, motion

## consciousness

_here defined as_ our awareness of ourselves and our environment

### cognitive neuroscience 

the study of how brain activity is linked with our mental processes.

* structural imagining -- brain's anatomy; good for identifying tumors and diseases
* functional imagining -- electromagnetic or metabolic activity; good for identifying correlations between stimuli actions and brain activity

selective attention -- focus of conscious awareness on a particular stimulus or group of stimuli
(there's *a lot* of stimuli at once and we are consciously aware of only a few
of them at once -- the most important ones usually)  
selective inattention also exists

## sleep

you're still alive and conscious

* NREM-1 -- hypnagogic sensations (body jerking)
* NREM-2 -- sleep spindles, but can be easily awakened
* NREM-3 -- brief dreams
* REM -- vivid visual dreams

during REM, your motor cortex is *veeery active* but your brain stem blocks the
messages, leaving your muscles so relaxed that you're basically paralysed.
this repeats every ~90 minutes

bad sleep (not enough or too much) causes hormones to become whacky (dysfunctions,
overeating, depression..).

you're able to dream of *all stimuli* stumbled upon during the day -- including
the unconscious ones.

## altered states

_hypnosis_ -- calm, trance-like state during which you tend to have heightened concentration
and focus, and in which you're typically more open to suggestion

_psychoactive drugs_ -- chemical substances that alter your mood and perception

* depressants -- mellow, slowness, suppression of bodily activity; alcohol, tranquilizers, opiates
* stimulants -- excite neural activity, self-confidence, speed up bodily activity; caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines
* hallucinogens -- distort perceptions, evoke sensory images; plant, fungal, synthetic (e.g. lsd)

## memory

* recall -- retrieval of information learned earlier
  ("---- is the capital of greece")
* recognition -- identification of items learned earlier
  ("which of the following was not an ancient city in greece")
* relearning -- reinforcing old information (relearn shit you have forgotten)

__atkinson-shiffrin memory model__
1. sensory register -- sensory information enters memory
2. short-term memory -- receives and holds input from both the sensory register
   and the long-term memory
3. long-term memory -- essentially a hard drive that stores *everything* such
   that memories can be later retrieved

__working memory__ -- conscious, active processing of incoming auditory and 
visual-spatial information, and of information retrieved from long-term memory.
[baddeley-hitch working memory model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory)
essentially replaces the short-term memory in the atkinson-shiffrin model.

_explicit memory_ -- shit that you specifically want to remember  
_implicit memory_ -- shit that you remember without explicitly caring about it
(this is how you learn most of your shit -- associations and stimuli; this is
what behaviorism is about)

long-term memory storage is not quite understood.. yet.

_shallow processing_ -- encoding information on basic auditory or visual levels,
based on the sound, structure or appearance of a word (e.g. brain anatomy and
latin words, without understanding the latin behind them)  
_deep processing_ -- encoding semantically, based on actual meaning associated
with the words (actually understanding the latin and therefore easily knowing
what is what)

_retrieval cues_ -- stuff that helps to retrieve specific memories; similar scent,
the song that was playing, the temperature, something else that reminds you
of the memories

_priming_ -- activating associations non-consciously (i.e. if you talk, or if
you keep thinking and you keep remembering, you non-consciously remember
more and more, because the memories are bound and connected)

our states and emotions can also serve as retrieval cues; e.g. when you're sad,
you tend to prime negative associations and retrieve bad memories.

_primacy effect_ -- shit that you learn first is easily remembered  
_recency effect_ -- shit that you learn last is easily remembered  
everything inbetween is harder to remember

tl;dr -- there's a lot of problems with making wrong memories, retrieving
wrong connections, deterioration etc.

## motivation

the need or desire to do something

* evolutionary perspective -- instincts (complex, unlearned behaviors that have
  a fixed pattern throughout a species -- shit that doesn't require learning and
  it just happens)
* drive-reduction -- a physiological need, or drive, compels us to reduce
  a need (you're hungry -- eat, you're tired -- sleep); it's all about maintaining
  homeostasis -- a balance in our biological systems
* optimal arousal -- balance between stimulation and relaxation
* maslow's hierarchy of needs

essentially, we are driven by
* sex
* hunger
* the need to belong

decline in one need may lead to decline in another need.

## developmental psychology

__jean piaget__. this is the yale lesson that i didn't skip (5th one), but didn't
write down either because it's so fucking boring :D

_assimilation_ -- if faced with something new, the learning of new information
is explained by known information (if you've never seen a deer but have seen a
horse, you might call a deer 'a weird horse')  
_accommodation_ -- learning, that there's new information that doesn't quite fit
into one's current understanding

tl;dr -- there are holes in piaget's theories but essentially the point is, that
we are learning relatively fast in the first few months and the ways we learn
etc. the most important fact is that children think *very differently* from how
adults think.

## harlow and child development

children don't only require food and nourishment, but most importantly, for their
mental health and development, comfort, touch, contact and love
(specifically, the feeling that they are loved).

attachment styles studied in children (ainsworth's styles of attachment):
* secure -- as long as mom is nearby, they explore and interact positively
* insecure avoidant -- little interest in mom, little interest in stranger
* insecure ambivalent -- afraid of the stranger, scared when mom left,
  angry when mom came back

sensitive and attentive mothers raise securely attached kids  
less responsive mothers who often ignored their children, or super-anxious mothers
who obsessed over every little thing, often raised insecurely attached kids

## erikson's life crises

erik erikson came up with the table that each person, depending on their age,
is going through a primary life crisis
* infancy -- trust vs mistrust
* toddlerhood -- autonomy vs shame and doubt
* preschool -- initiative vs guilt
* elementary school -- competence vs inferiority
* adolescence -- identity vs role confusion
* young adulthood -- intimacy vs isolation
* middle adulthood -- generativity vs stagnation
* late adulthood -- integrity vs despair

## humanism

maslow and _rogers_

person-centered perspective on personality:
* genuineness 
* acceptance
* empathy

## personality tests

there's a lot of them. the myers-briggs (4x4/16 personalities) is a classic,
but the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory is the most widely used one
(MMPI-3 as of today).

## intelligence

the ability to learn from experience, solve problems, and use knowledge to adapt
to new experiences.

it's measurable, but _very fucking complicated_
