> Early supportive interventions, psychoeducation, and case management appear to be helpful in acutely traumatized individuals, because these approaches promote engagement in ongoing care and may facilitate entry into evidence-based psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatments [II]. Encouraging acutely traumatized persons to first rely on their inherent strengths, their existing support networks, and their own judgment may also reduce the need for further intervention [II]. In populations of patients who have experienced multiple recurrent traumas, there is little evidence to suggest that early supportive care delivered as a standalone treatment will result in lasting reductions in PTSD symptoms. However, no evidence suggests that early supportive care is harmful. ___In contrast, psychological debriefings or single-session techniques are not recommended, as they may increase symptoms in some settings and appear to be ineffective in treating individuals with ASD and in preventing PTSD___.

> No controlled studies of psychodynamic psychotherapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), or hypnosis have been conducted that would establish data-based evidence of their efficacy as an early or preventive intervention for ASD or PTSD.

> For patients with a diagnosis of ASD or PTSD, available evidence and clinical experience suggest that a number of psychotherapeutic interventions may be useful. _Patients with ASD may be helped by cognitive behavior therapy and other exposure-based therapies_ [II]. In addition, _cognitive behavior therapy is an effective treatment for core symptoms of acute and chronic PTSD_ [I]. _EMDR is also effective_ [II]. _Stress inoculation, imagery rehearsal, and prolonged exposure techniques may also be indicated for treatment of PTSD and PTSD-associated symptoms such as anxiety and avoidance_ [II]. The shared element of controlled exposure of some kind may be the critical intervention.

> In evaluations that occur shortly after exposure to the traumatic event, particularly in emergency settings, the initial clinical response consists of stabilizing and supportive medical care as well as supportive psychiatric care and assessment, including assessment of potential dangerousness to self or others. __Addressing the individual’s requirements for medical care, rest, nutrition, and control of injury-related pain is important for assuring the patient’s physical health, enhancing the patient’s experience of safety, and initiating the therapeutic relationship. Such interactions with trauma-exposed individuals will always entail sensitivity__ to the patient’s wishes and to the changing symptoms, fears, and interpersonal needs that unfold after trauma exposure.

> During the first 48–72 hours after a traumatic event, some individuals may be very aroused, anxious, or angry, whereas others may appear minimally affected or “numb” as a result of injury, pain, or dissociative phenomena. In triage or emergency department settings, an in-depth exploration of the traumatic event and the patient’s experiences may increase distress but may be required for medical or safety reasons. For example, after physical or sexual assault, recounting events in response to the evaluator’s questions or the mere gender of the evaluator may have a distressing effect in some individuals. Similarly, after an event involving death or injury to a family member, a clinician may need to obtain or disclose upsetting information, while gauging the patient’s response as part of the evaluation. __Insensitive or premature exploration of recent life-threatening events or losses can be counterproductive, leading the patient to avoid medical care, whereas other individuals may find in-depth exploration of recent events helpful.__

> ... However, several studies have noted that exposure may increase rather than decrease symptoms in some individuals. _Stress inoculation training involving breathing exercises, relaxation training_, ___thought stopping___, _role playing, and cognitive restructuring has also proven effective alone and in combination with prolonged exposure in reducing PTSD symptoms_. ...
