my indoor plants :)

## TIPS

* __Cluster Plants__: Grouping plants together can help maintain a more humid
  microenvironment, which is beneficial for some species like ferns or peace
  lilies, especially during the dry winter months
* __Rotate Plants__: If you have a few plants that prefer more light but can
  tolerate less, you can rotate them in and out of the window area every few
  weeks to make sure they all get some exposure
* __Prune Regularly__: For trailing plants like Pothos (Epipremnum Aureum) and
  Philodendron Hederaceum, regularly prune back leggy growth to encourage
  bushier, fuller plants. It will also prevent them from overtaking your space.
* __Repotting__: Be mindful that some plants, like the Monstera or Dracaena,
  will eventually outgrow their pots. Consider repotting them every 1-2 years to
  provide them with more room to grow and fresh soil.
* __Watering in Winter__: In winter, most plants' growth slows down, so reduce
  watering frequency. Check the soil moisture before watering to avoid
  overwatering, which can lead to root rot.
* __Dust the Leaves__: Especially in low light, dusty leaves can block the
  limited light the plants receive. Wipe them down occasionally to keep them
  clean and maximize their photosynthesis.

## Plants

### Sansevieria (Snake Plant)
* can thrive in near darkness
* water every few weeks (allow soil to dry completely)
* air purifier

### Zamioculcas Zamiifolia (ZZ Plant)
* doesn't need much light; can survive in low light conditions
* water sparingly (once every 2-3 weeks)
* drought-tolerant

### Epipremnum Aureum (Pothos)
* doesn't need much light but can tolerate various lighting conditions
* water when soil dries out
* trailing growth

### Spathiphyllum (Peace Lily)
* does well in low-light, but blooms better in moderate light
* keep soil slightly moist; in winter, allow it to dry out a bit more between waterings
* air purifier
* full leaves, blooming flowers

### Aspidistra Elatior (Cast Iron Plant)
* thrives and is highly tolerant to low light and even neglect
* water when soil dries out (once every couple of weeks)
* large leaves, very low maintenance

### Philodendron Hederaceum (Heartleaf Philodendron)
* low to moderate indirect light; adapts to lower light conditions
* water when soil dries out, less in winter (goes into dormancy)
* trailing growth

### Dracaena Marginata
* prefers moderate light but fine with indirect or low light (slower growth in low light)
* water when soil dries out; reduce watering in winter

### Monstera Deliciosa
* needs moderate to bright indirect light (give window exposure for better growth)
* water when the top few inches of soil dry out
* grows _large and fast_

### Nephrolepis Exaltata (Boston Fern)
* prefers bright indirect light; avoid direct sun
* keep soil consistently moist and mist regularly (especially during winter)
* ideal for humid environments; perfect near a window or clustered with other plants
